# PiTemplar

![Knight](pik1.png)

PiTemplar is a local cloud\micro file server that is interactive. It offers storage on your Local Area network anytime, anywhere!

First step is obviously the hardware. 

https://a.co/d/fTyeqv4     Raspberry pi Zero 2W

https://a.co/d/5Apdn16     Upgraded heatsink

https://a.co/d/bW6hi50     Screen, makes it more fun

https://a.co/d/inzVWE7     Pisugar 3 battery, optional, but highly recommended. Makes it a true mobile server.

Installation begins simply by downloading RaspberryPiImager, you want to use a Pi OS Lite for command line only. That's all you'll need.

For this specific project, I named everything either PiTemplar or templar. so default username PiTemplar, default password pitemplar, device name PiTemplar. Feel free to make modifications but for initial setup purposes let's stick to this. Set up SSH as well with those credentials so you have an easy reference starting point and no concerns over remembering credentials. The initial network can be either your home network, or setup a hotspot on your phone with SSID PiTemplar and password pitemplar initially then add your network on the web GUI once established. See the pattern here? Moving on...

Once RaspberryPiOS Lite is installed (32 preferably, doesn't really matter), Let's begin configuring the Pi to make components work. 

## NOTE: IF YOU RUN INTO ISSUES COPYING FROM THIS README FILE, JUST RUN THIS IN CODE VIEW!

# Make the screen work, Bread and butter of PiTemplar!!!

Waveshare e-paper uses SPI.

    sudo raspi-config

Go to:
Interface Options → SPI → Enable  

Reboot:

    sudo reboot

Install Waveshare e-Paper library  
Install dependencies first:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-pil python3-numpy git
    sudo apt install python3-psutil


Clone Waveshare’s repo:

    git clone https://github.com/waveshareteam/e-Paper.git
    cd e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/examples/
    python3 epd_2in13_V4_test.py

Your drivers will be here:  
~/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python

so make sure you are in /home/pitemplar/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/

    cd /home/pitemplar/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/

Now clone the pitemplar repository 

    git clone https://github.com/Modernknight101/PiTemplar.git

From the driver directory:

    cd ~/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/PiTemplar
    python3 mem_display.py


You should now see:

Disk Used:  
Wifi:  
IP:  
CPU:

Now stop it with Ctrl+C so you can finish the program.

Start on boot  
Edit crontab:

    crontab -e

no crontab for pitemplar - using an empty one Select an editor. To change later, run select-editor again. 1. /bin/nano <---- easiest 2. /usr/bin/vim.tiny 3. /bin/ed Choose 1-3 [1]:

pick option 1  
Add:

    @reboot python3 /home/templar/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/PiTemplar/mem_display.py 

Save:  
CTRL+O → ENTER  
CTRL+X

 Make sure the script is executable (recommended)

    chmod +x /home/pitemplar/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/PiTemplar/mem_display.py

Create a systemd service file

    sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/epaper-status.service

Paste exactly this (adjust nothing unless noted):

    [Unit]
    Description=Waveshare ePaper System Status
    After=multi-user.target
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    User=pitemplar
    WorkingDirectory=/home/pitemplar/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/PiTemplar
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/pitemplar/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/PiTemplar/mem_display.py
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=10
    Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
    
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target


Save:

CTRL+O → ENTER  
CTRL+X

Reload systemd and enable the service

    sudo systemctl daemon-reexec
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable epaper-status.service

Start it now (no reboot needed)
    
    sudo systemctl start epaper-status.service

Within ~30 seconds, your e-paper should update.

Check status (VERY useful)  
systemctl status epaper-status.service


You should see:

● epaper-status.service - Waveshare ePaper System Status  
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/epaper-status.service; enabled; preset: enabled)

Jan 23 22:35:39 PiTemplar python3[904]: mem_display.py started (Pirata One title + SSID + disk usage)


No red error messages

🔁 Reboot test (important)
    
    sudo reboot

After boot:

Wait ~30–60 seconds

Screen should refresh automatically

If it does → you’re done ✅

🧠 Common Gotchas (you’re already safe)  
✅ Uses full path to python3  
✅ Runs as user templar (SPI access OK)  
✅ Working directory set (imports work)  
✅ Restart enabled if script crashes
 

# Now let's do SAMBA to make it work as a true file server now that the screen works!

## Process has been automated to make it more efficient.  
Run the NAS setup script:

    cd /home/pitemplar/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/PiTemplar

    chmod +x setup_pi_nas.sh
    sudo ./setup_pi_nas.sh

NOTE: INITIAL PASSWORD "pitemplar" IS RECOMMENDED. CHANGE THE PASSWORD AFTER INSTALL!!!

### if you missed that AND SOMETHING WENT WRONG:

    sudo apt purge samba samba-common samba-common-bin cifs-utils smbclient -y

### Then rerun the script and use "pitemplar" as the password. Otherwise if everything works skip this step.

Afterwards, your Windows machine should be able to connect using the Pi’s Hostname or IP.

Test from another device  
Windows  
\\pitemplar\private

macOS / Linux  
smb://templar/private

To change passwords on the Share:

    sudo smbpasswd pitemplar <NEW PASSWORD>



# Let's do web GUI, this will allow us to switch networks easier.  
This process is automated with a Bash script to eliminate potential errors.

    cd /home/pitemplar/e-Paper/RaspberryPi_JetsonNano/python/PiTemplar
    chmod +x setup_web_gui.sh
    sudo ./setup_web_gui.sh

After this the Web GUI should be up. Login with <IP>:8080 and check out the features!
